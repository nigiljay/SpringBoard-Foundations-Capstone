#Tentative Capstone Project Topics and Short Descriptions for Foundations of Data Science Course (2016) - For Mentor Review 

#TOPIC-1: “Examining Maternity Leave Policies in the United States”

As the workforce gets increasingly diverse with women working in every job function across all the industries, it is important to examine maternity leave benifits across these industries and companies in the United States.

The goal of this project is to shed light on this policy by quantitatively examining the number of weeks of paid and unpaid maternity leave across different types of industries in the United States.

The results from this work are intended to serve as a benefit guide to employees. The intent is also to provide the average and maternity leave range across different industries in the United States, which can be used as a tool to negotiate employment contracts and leverage maximum benefit. 

For employers, the results should motivate them to revise or improve their policies to ensure they maintain their competitive edge, thereby retaining talent. 

For policy makers at the State and Federal level, the results are intended to serve as a general guide to start debating the expansions of the current Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) to include paid Maternity Leave.
